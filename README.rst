CellO: Cell Ontology-based Classification
=======================================================

CellO (Cell Ontology-based classification) is a Python package for performing cell type classification of human RNA-seq data. CellO makes hierarchical predictions against the Cell Ontology (http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/cl.html). These classifiers were trained on nearly all of the human primary cell, bulk RNA-seq data in the NCBI's Sequence Read Archive.

For instructions on installing and running CellO, see the GitHub repository: https://github.com/deweylab/CellO

For more details regarding the underlying method, see the paper:
